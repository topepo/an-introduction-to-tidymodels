# Modeling in R


.pull-left[
.font90[
* R has always had a rich set of modeling tools that it inherited from S. For example, the formula interface has made it simple to specify potentially complex model structures.   

* _R has cutting edge models_. Many researchers in various domains use R as their primary computing environment and their work often results in R packages.

* _It is easy to port or link to other applications_. R doesn't try to be everything to everyone.
]
]

.pull-right[
However, there is a huge _consistency problem_. For example: 
* There are two primary methods for specifying what terms are in a model. Not all models have both. 
* 99% of model functions automatically generate dummy variables. 
* Many package developers don't know much about the language and omit OOP and other core R components.

Two examples follow...

# Within-Package Inconsistency: `glmnet` Predictions

```{r glmnet-mod, include = FALSE}
sim_n <- 300

set.seed(1244)
dat <- data.frame(
  two_class = rep(letters[1:2], each = sim_n / 2),
  three_class = rep(letters[1:3], each = sim_n / 3),
  numeric = rnorm(sim_n) + 10,
  x1 = rnorm(sim_n),
  x2 = rnorm(sim_n),
  x3 = rnorm(sim_n),
  x4 = rnorm(sim_n)
)

x <- as.matrix(dat[,-(1:3)])
new_x <- head(x, 2)
rownames(new_x) <- paste0("sample_", 1:2)

reg_mod <-
  glmnet(x, y = dat$numeric, lambda = c(0.01, 0.1, 1))

two_class_mod <-
  glmnet(
    x,
    y = dat$two_class,
    nlambda = 3,
    family = "binomial", 
    lambda = c(0.01, 0.1, 1)
  )

three_class_mod <-
  glmnet(
    x,
    y = dat$three_class,
    nlambda = 3,
    family = "multinomial", 
    lambda = c(0.01, 0.1, 1)
  )

three_pred <- predict(three_class_mod, newx = new_x, type = "response")
three_pred <- apply(three_pred, 3, function(x) data.frame(x)) 
three_pred <- dplyr::bind_rows(three_pred)
three_pred <- dplyr::mutate(three_pred, lambda = rep(three_class_mod$lambda, each = 2))
three_pred <- tibble::as_tibble(three_pred)
```
 
The `glmnet` model can be used to fit regularized generalized linear models with a mixture of L<sub>1</sub> and L<sub>2</sub> penalties. 

We'll look at what happens when we get predictions for a regression model (i.e. numeric _Y_) as well as classification models where _Y_ has two or three categorical values. 

The models shown below contain solutions for three regularization values ( $\lambda$ ). 

The predict method gives the results for all three at once (`r emojifont::emoji('+1')`). 


---

# Numeric `glmnet` Predictions

Predicting a numeric outcome for two new data points:


```{r glmnet-reg}
new_x

predict(reg_mod, newx = new_x)
```

A matrix result and we will assume that the $\lambda$ values are in the same order as what we gave to the model fit function.


---

# `glmnet` Class Predictions

Predicting an outcome with two classes:

```{r glmnet-2class}
predict(two_class_mod, newx = new_x, type = "class")
```

Not factors! That's different from what is required for the `y` argument. From `?glmnet`:

> For `family="binomial"` [`y`] should be either a factor with two levels, or a two-column matrix of counts or proportions


I'm guessing that this is because they want to keep the result a matrix (to be consistent). 


---

# `glmnet` Class Probabilities (Two Classes)

```{r glmnet-2class-prob}
predict(two_class_mod, newx = new_x, type = "response")
```

Okay, we get a matrix of the probability for the _second_ level of the outcome factor. 

To make this fit into most code, we can manually calculate the other probability. No biggie!


---

# `glmnet` Class Probabilities (Three Classes)

.pull-left[

```{r glmnet-3class-prob}
predict(three_class_mod, newx = new_x, 
        type = "response")
```

]
.pull-right[


`r emojifont::emoji('flushed')`

No more matrix results. 3D array and we get all of the probabilities back this time. 

_Am I working for `glmnet` or is it is working for me?_

Maybe a structure like this would work better:

```{r better-glmnet, echo = FALSE}
three_pred
```

]

# What We Need

Unless you are doing a simple one-off data analysis, the lack of consistency between, and sometimes within, R packages can be very frustrating. 

If we could agree on a set of common conventions for interfaces, return values, and other components, everyone's life would be easier. 

Once we agree on conventions, **two challenges** are: 

 * As of `r format(Sys.time(), "%b %Y")`, there are over `r pkgs`K R packages on CRAN. How do we "harmonize" these without breaking everything? 
 
 * How can we guide new R users (or people unfamiliar with R) in making good choices in their modeling packages?
 
These prospective and retrospective problems will be addressed in a minute.

# The Tidyverse

.pull-left[

The [tidyverse](http://www.tidyverse.org/) is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures. 


The principles of the tidyverse: 

1. Reuse existing data structures.
1. Compose simple functions with the pipe.
1. Embrace functional programming.
1. Design for humans.

This results in more specific conventions around interfaces, function naming, etc. 

]s
.pull-right[
For example, we try to use common prefixes for auto-complete:  `grid_latin_hypercube()`, `grid_max_entropy()`, ...

There is also the notion of [tidy data](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf): 

1. Each variable forms a column.
1. Each observation forms a row.
1. Each type of observational unit forms a table.

Based on these ideas, we can create modeling packages that have predictable results and are a pleasure to use. 

] 


---

# Tidymodels 

`tidymodels` is a collection of modeling packages that live in the tidyverse and are designed in the same way. 

My goals for tidymodels are:

1. Encourage empirical validation and good methodology.

1. Smooth out diverse interfaces.

1. Build highly reusable infrastructure.

1. Enable a wider variety of methodologies.

The `tidymodels` packages address the *retrospective* and *prospective* issues. We are also developing a set of principles and templates to make *prospective* (new R packages) easy to create.

# Selected Modeling Packages 


* [`broom`](https://broom.tidymodels.org/) takes the messy output of built-in functions in R, such as `lm`, `nls`, or `t.test`, and turns them into tidy data frames.

* [`recipes`](https://recipes.tidymodels.org/) is a general data preprocessor with a modern interface. It can create model matrices that incorporate feature engineering, imputation, and other tools.

* [`rsample`](https://rsample.tidymodels.org/) has infrastructure for _resampling_ data so that models can be assessed and empirically validated. 

* [`parsnip`](https://parsnip.tidymodels.org/) gives us a unified modeling interface.

* [`tune`](https://tune.tidymodels.org/) has functions for grid search and sequential optimization of model parameters.

# Principles of Modeling Packages

.font90[
We have [a set of _guidelines_](https://tidymodels.github.io/model-implementation-principles/) for making good modeling packages. For example:

 * Separate the interface that the **modeler** uses from the code to do the computations. They serve two very different purposes. 
 * Have multiple interfaces (e.g. formula, x/y, etc). 
 * The _user-facing interface_ should use the most appropriate data structures for the data (as opposed to the computations). For example, factor outcomes versus 0/1 indicators and data frames versus matrices. 
 * `type = "prob"` for class probabilities `r emojifont::emoji('smile')`. 
 * Use S3 methods.  
 * The `predict` method should give standardized, predictable results. 

Rather than try to make methodologists into software developers, have tools to **help them create high quality modeling packages**. 

]

---

# Making better packages `r I(hexes(c("hardhat")))`

We have methods for creating all of the S3 scaffolding for modeling packages. 

You have some functions for creating a model fit; `hardhat` provides a package directory using best practices: 

```{r hardhat, eval = FALSE}
library(hardhat)

create_modeling_package("~/tmp/lantern", model = "lantern_mlp")
```

There is a [video demo](https://canal.uned.es/video/5dd25b9f5578f275e407dd88) that shows how to create a package in 9 steps.


---
# What's coming up

### MLOps

Model Operations tools for deploying, monitoring, and updating models.

### censored data models (a.k.a survival analysis)

These models are used to predict time-to-event data (in medicine, sports, HR, etc).

### Case weights

Not sexy. Really tedious. Often requested.  This will impact many of the tidymodels packages.

### shinymodels

A package for interactive interrogation of model predictions.
